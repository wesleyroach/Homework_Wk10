                Wes, thank you for all the support, guidance and assistance; your reassuring words have always been of comfort and your advice inspiring. 
              While most managers give orders, you gave direction. Other managers drive targets, you empower through vision. Rathen than leading by authority, you always led by respoect. In NAB-esque style you have always been more of a friend and less of a colleague, more of a leader and less of a boss.
              </p>

                It's been an  absolute pleasure working with you over the last 5 years. Thank you for being a great mentor to me, not in  just the workplace but also  in life.

                  we would not be in the good position we are today without Wes's amazing support, lateral thinking view and ability to identify any potential gaps across all tasks and controls. Wes has also been the driving force with regulatory education and training sessions across Operations, and has on more than one occasion stepped in to backfill roles, not to mention helping me with many , many interviews!  Wes has been an absolute pleasure to work with, incredibly knowledgeable, always the go to guy with an amazing ability to pull together a powerpoint presentation at the drop of a hat... and one of the best presenters I have come across over the years. Wes, you will be greatly missed.
                  â€¨I would like to personally thank Wes for his dedication, support and resilience, it is very much appreciated and I will certainly miss the laughs!
